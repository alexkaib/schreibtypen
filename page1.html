	    <h1>The Adventurer</h1>
	    <h2>The Journey is the Destination</h2>
	</div>
	<row>
	<div class="col-md-3">
	    <ul>Benefits of this process:
	        <li>You write freely and unencumbered and it is rarely boring.</li>
            <li>You are open to new ideas and you find them when you write quite often.</li>
            <li>You can quickly see that you have accomplished something.</li>
	    </ul>
	</div>
	<div class="col-md-6">
	    <p>You like jumpstarting into writing. You know how to start and you develop ideas and often even structures while writing. Famous adventurers include Andre Breton, Martin Walser, and Siegfried Lenz.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-3">
        <ul>Potential risks:
	        <li>You might deviate from the central issue.</li>
	        <li>You will usually need more time for revisions.</li>
	        <li>It can be hard for you to find a fitting ending.</li>

	    <h1>The Chipmunk</h1>
	    <h2>Collecting and Jumping</h2>
	</div>
	<row>
	<div class="col-md-3">
	    <ul>Benefits of this process:
	        <li>You are flexible and can work on a different part of the text when you get stuck.</li>
            <li>You take many small steps, which reduces anxiety for writing longer texts.</li>
            <li>The provisional nature of your procedure prevents unhealthy perfectionism.</li>
	    </ul>
	</div>
	<div class="col-md-6">
	    <p>Instead of writing in a linear fashion from A to B, you jump around from one part of the draft to another. You tend to interrupt writing to research additional information. Some famous Chipmunks are Ingeborg Bachmann, Gunther Grass, and Thomas Mann.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-3">
        <ul>Potential risks:
	        <li>You might postpone difficult parts of your text indefinitely.</li>
	        <li>You can easily lose track.</li>
	        <li>It might be hard for you to find a fitting ending.</li>
	    </ul>

	    <h1>The Decathlete</h1>
	    <h2>Several Starts Before Getting to the Point</h2>
	</div>
	<row>
	<div class="col-md-3">
	    <ul>Benefits of this process:
	        <li>You can write without struggling with perfectionism if you embrace your approach.</li>
            <li>You utilize writing for thinking.</li>
            <li>Your final texts are very focused and straightforward.</li>
	    </ul>
	</div>
	<div class="col-md-6">
	    <p>You write your text in several versions. You often throw paper away or open a new file, start several times or (re)write parts of the text. Famous decathletes are Friedrich Duerrenmatt (entire books written in several versions) and Heinrich Boell (chunks of text written several times).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-3">
        <ul>Potential risks:
	        <li>You have to get rid of much text that won't appear in the final version.</li>
            <li>Your approach is (seemingly) more time consuming.</li>
            <li>You could lose overview if too many versions arise.</li>

	    <h1>The Gold Digger</h1>
	    <h2>Planning and Digging Deep</h2>
	</div>
	<row>
	<div class="col-md-3">
	    <ul>Benefits of this process:
	        <li>Your aproach is straightforward and allows you to plan your time efficiently.</li>
            <li>You can always find the thread of your text.</li>
            <li>You can explain your plans to others and therefore write in teams as well.</li>
	    </ul>
	</div>
	<div class="col-md-6">
	    <p>You prefer to make a plan before you start writing and follow this plan as you write. In other words, you dig deep with a treasure map in hand in search of the perfect text. Famous Gold Diggers are Peter Handke and Hermann Hesse (planning without taking notes) or Henning Mankell and Carl Zuckmayer (complex written outlines)</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-3">
        <ul>Potential risks:
	        <li>You are not open to new ideas.</li>
            <li>You can lose yourself in the planning and start too late to write.</li>
            <li>It takes a long time before you see tangible results in the form of text because of time spent on planning.</li>
